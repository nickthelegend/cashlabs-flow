# Product Overview

## Project Name
Flow - Drag-and-Drop Smart Contract Builder

## Purpose
Flow is a visual, no-code platform for building and deploying smart contracts and transactions on the Algorand blockchain. It enables users to create complex blockchain applications through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface without writing code.

## Value Proposition
- **No Code Required**: Build smart contracts visually without programming knowledge
- **Lightning Fast**: Deploy contracts in minutes instead of days
- **Secure & Audited**: Pre-built, tested components ensure contract security
- **Full Control**: Direct wallet integration maintains user sovereignty over contracts

## Key Features

### Visual Flow Builder
- Drag-and-drop interface for creating transaction flows
- Real-time visual feedback with node-based architecture
- Support for multiple transaction types (payment, asset transfer, application calls)
- Interactive canvas with zoom, pan, and minimap navigation

### Algorand Integration
- Native support for Algorand blockchain operations
- Multiple wallet connections (Pera, Defly, Exodus, Lute)
- Transaction simulation before execution
- Direct on-chain deployment

### Transaction Types Supported
- **Account Management**: Wallet connection and account operations
- **Payment Transactions**: ALGO transfers between accounts
- **Asset Operations**: Create, transfer, and freeze assets
